# Models-Statistics-and-Predictions
This repo contains all of my work in working with open data to make analysis. It will be based on varying subjects like Health, Physics, Electronics and many more. I will also use it to help spread awareness about things.
1. WHO Suicide Statistics : attempt to analyse the data to find a correlation between the population and number of suicides in a country over the course of time
2. Diabetes (Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression for Women) : attempt to quantify the accuracy of both methods in detecting if a woman has diabetes or not.
3. Wigner's Spherical Law : As part of my assignment in STAT 413 class - Intro to Computing for Data Science at the University of Alberta
